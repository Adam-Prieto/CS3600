<p>Study time:</p>
<p>20 minutes</p>
<p>I learned that paging is placing a fixed-size of block of logical address space that is linked in physical address space by a page table. Segmentation is variable-sized blocks of logical address space all of the components of a program into a single address space by using a segmentation table. The advantages of both can be combined by using two tables to map pages into the physical memory.</p>
<p>This collaboration would have been more useful if my internet didn't crash while we were presenting. It did help to read aloud, though. I do think it's interesting to see how one can overcome storage problems, and how to curb issues of various implementation as well.</p>
