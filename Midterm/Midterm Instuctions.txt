Midterm Instructions
--------------------

Complete the given Program ( see below) without changing the outline to synchronize readers and writers trying to access the critical section(CS).

Execute the program without any change see the output and understand the race condition.
Take the screenshot of the output of given program (with race condition). 
Modify the program using semaphores constructs to avoid the race condition.(Do not delete any given statements)
Display the output as given below if the number of readers are 8 and writers are entered as 2.
Take the screen shot of program output after solving the race condition.

Points: 
	    Semaphore initialization = 5

            Appropriate semaphore locks and variables used for reader and writer = 20 

            Correct reader function = 5

            Correct writer function = 5

            The program executes without error to give the output = 5

            The output displays reader and writer numbers (see the sample below) = 5 

            Submitted program, screen shots of outputs before and after modification of program = 5
